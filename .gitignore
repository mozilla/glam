# Private data
#
# Private data should be saved to directories named "private-data" for clarity.
# The uniqueness of the name also allows us to ignore any directories with that
# name throughout the entire repo, as we do below. That said, private data was
# saved to a directory named "tests/data" in the past, so we should continue to
# ignore that directory in perpetuity just in case some developers haven't moved
# their data yet.
